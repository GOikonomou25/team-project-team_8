# Group 8 Imdb Ratings Markdown

## Introduction

This is the Markdown document for group 8. Each member contributed on the markdown and did their own analysis about imdb datasets. After each individual presented their analysis, a joint markdown file is created.

## Pre - Analysis

Loading the `tidyverse` package:

```{r setup, echo = F, warning = F, error = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

If you have your current working directory where your markdown file is, `setwd('../../data/dataset1')` should direct you to the databases. But since each database is in another folder, a function can come handy.

```{r}
wd_changer <- function(x) {
  wd <- str_c('../../data/dataset', x)
  setwd(wd)
} #I think this easy function is pretty self-explanatory.

#Let's try if the function works.

wd_changer(3)

getwd() 

#Apparently, it does!

``` 


### Dataset: title.basics.tsv.gz

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

wd_changer(2) #My file is at the second database folder.

prototype <- T 

if(prototype == T) {
  title_basics <- read_tsv('title.basics.tsv.gz', n_max = 200)
} #Loading only first 200 rows of the data just for exploratory data analysis.

```

After this first step, let's take a look at the variables and produce some explarotary plots.

```{r}

dim(title_basics)

str(title_basics)

summary(title_basics)

```

In this dataset, there are 9 columns.

1. `tconst` is a identifier tag which other tables also possess. 
2. `titleType` is read in as a character column but can also be treated as a **factor**. It contains information about the type of the visual product such as a short-movie, a series or a movie.
3. `primaryTitle` is a character column for the final title that the visual product was released in.
4. `originalTitle` is also a character column but it is the first title that the visual product had. It might contain foreign language titles or the original title draft before it got changed to something else.
5. `isAdult` is a numeric variable which tells if the product is for adults or not. If it is for adults, the value is *1*. If not, the value is *0*.
6. `startYear` is the release year of the product. This prototype only includes earliest years so maximum and minimum values can be obtained if the whole database is loaded in.
7. `endYear` this character column is only viable for TV Series. It keeps track how many years that the series has lasted. For all other media, the value is *\N*.
8. `runtimeMinutes` is a character column but **it should actually be a numeric one**. It represents how long the product is.
9. `genres` is a character column that includes an array of values. A column containing two values is not recommended for a tidy dataset and thus, **the values should be filtered and separated for further analysis.**

#### Main Takeaways

* titleType can be converted into a factor,
* isAdult should be filtered while doing further analysis,
* endYear is unnecessary for movies,
* runtimeMinutes should be converted into an integer,
* genres should be filtered and split for a tidier frame.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
